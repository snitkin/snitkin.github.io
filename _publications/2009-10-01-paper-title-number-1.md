Do people segregate within a group in response to increased group diversity? I study the
impact of increased exposure to low-income students on gifted program assignment in North
Carolina elementary schools. Using cohort-to-cohort variation within a school, I find that a 10
percentage point increase in the low-income share of a student’s peers increases high-income
students’ reading gifted status by 4.8% the following year, with no impacts for low-income
students. Both high- and low-income students also experience gains in teacher evaluations
from more low-income peers, consistent with a relative-rank theory of grading, but low-income
students face greater negative impacts on test scores. These results indicate that increased
economic diversity in schools worsens inequality in gifted program enrollment.
